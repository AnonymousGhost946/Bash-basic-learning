#! /bin/bash
echo "hello world"  # echo is simply used to display the text on our screen.

# as we can at the top of the code a line #!/bin/bash . this is known as the shebang . Mean this tell that which shell have to use to run the code. Mean there are multiple shell like bourne again shell(bash) , k shell, z shell etc.
# why this line important mostly this line don't create too much difference but it might cause some errors might be a syntax error mean that if we using k shell and our script is in bash script mean some syntax error because in our terminal our default shell in k she but our script is in bash. So it might cause some errors.That's why we write the shebang line. You might see the # and might think this is a comment but this is not comment it si know as shebang line that tell which sheel have to use to run this script.


# comments 

# in bash ther are two types of comments. 
#single line comments . I mostly use single line comments as you can see i am writing this line.
#multi line comments
