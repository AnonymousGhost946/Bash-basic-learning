# Today our topic is symbol
# [] Symbol is use to execute the arithemetical calculation
# Remeber when we condition then we have space at the start and also space before end. But in symbol we dont give any space even after = and inside no spcaes are allowed. And remember this is symbol not condition.

# And you might remember we study expr before for calculation [] symbol work same it also perform arithemetical calculation.

num1=23
num2=23

result=$[num1 + num2]
echo "The sum of $num1 and $num2 is $result"

num3=20
num4=2
result2=$[num3 / num4]
echo "The division of $num3 and $num4 is $result2"

# Your first task is to research and see is expr and symbol is modern way to do arithemetic calculation or not
