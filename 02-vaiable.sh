# in this tutorail we are going to learn how many types of variable and how we can made variable 

my_variable='value'
#my_variable = 'value'
echo $my_variable

#as we can see above we can make variable in bash just typing there name and then assign them a value 

# next we can see that we use echo whcih is use to just directly print anything on the screen

#as we can see we use $ dollar sign to print that variable value

#note that no space allow making vairable  as we can see the comment line on line no 4. If we uncomment it and then  run our code then we can see it show us error 

# Important Note 
# in bach there is special datatypes like other languages have for example python, javascript, c , c++ or else  but still we can check what datatype of our value is . we will discuss it later not yet

#and the vaiable makign mehtod is same like other languages mean don't start with Number or _ , - , or any special character. in most of the languages mostly the professional use camel case and Underscore _ . remember don't put underscrore at the start of the variable it wrong almost all languages. you can use it like this ( my_name )  . or in camel case like this ( myName)
