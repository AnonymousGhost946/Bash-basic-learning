#! /bin/bash

echo"Enter your full name"

read fullName

echo "Your full name is  $fullName"

# we can take input form user with the help of read keyword

# note
# remeber to use Double quotes "" if you use '' single quotes then you see a error . In bash there is special dealing of strings that's why single quotes not work here like other languages 

# we learn before that when you want to use value of our variable then we can use $ sign to print that variable value yep.
